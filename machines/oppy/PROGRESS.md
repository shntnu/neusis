## Maintainer's Guide: Adding Progress Entries

**When to add entries:**
- After implementing a new feature or module
- When policy requirements are met
- After significant configuration changes
- When testing/validation completes

**Entry format:**

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD - [Brief Description]

**Goal**: [What you set out to accomplish]

**Implementation**: [What was added/changed - file paths, key config]

**Testing**: [How it was verified - commands run, results]

**Status**: [‚úÖ Complete | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | üîß In Progress | ‚ùå Blocked]

**Notes**: [Lessons learned, future improvements, related issues]
```

**Keep it concise:**
- Focus on *what* changed and *why*
- Include file paths for traceability
- Document test commands for future validation
- Link to policies when implementing requirements

## Remaining Work - Path to Full NixOS

> **Context**: These features exist in Ubuntu/Ansible (Spirit) but are missing or incomplete in NixOS.
> Once completed, imaging-server-maintenance `scripts/` can be archived and Spirit can migrate to NixOS.
>
> **Policy Source**: `../imaging-server-maintenance/policies/`
> **Current Implementation**: `../imaging-server-maintenance/scripts/`

### Critical - Blocking Spirit Migration

- [ ] **Sudo restriction**: Move users from admins ‚Üí regulars in `users/cslab.nix`
  - Current: All 8 users have wheel group (sudo)
  - Policy: 1-2 admins only post-migration
  - Action: Reclassify jewald, rshen, jfredinh, others as regulars

### High Priority - Security & Compliance

- [ ] **Security auditing**: Add to `cslab-monitoring.nix` or new `cslab-security.nix`
  - Detect undeclared users in imaging group
  - Log state changes to `/var/log/lab-scripts/`
  - Report group membership violations
  - Required for audit policy compliance

- [ ] **User lifecycle - locked users**: Extend `cslab-infrastructure.nix` for oppy
  - Read locked users from config, set shell to `/usr/sbin/nologin`, lock password
  - Preserve data but prevent login
  - Required for offboarding policy compliance
  - Extract to `lib/neusisOS.nix` when Spirit migrates

- [ ] **User lifecycle - removed users**: Extend `cslab-infrastructure.nix` for oppy
  - Archive to `/work/users/_archive/<username>_YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Change ownership to root:imaging, delete account
  - Required for offboarding policy compliance
  - Extract to `lib/neusisOS.nix` when Spirit migrates

- [ ] **Exact group membership enforcement**: Implement in oppy's user management
  - Current: additive only (users keep manual group additions)
  - Required: exact match (remove groups not in config)
  - May need activation script or lib modification
  - Prevents privilege creep, enforces security policy

### Medium Priority - Operational Features

- [ ] **Scratch cleanup**: Implement and enable 90-day retention
  - Write `scratch-cleanup.nu` script
  - Uncomment timer in `cslab-monitoring.nix:68-88`
  - Test with dry-run, deploy to production

- [ ] **Emergency account safeguards**: Prevent managing critical accounts
  - Add safety check in neusisOS lib
  - Fail build if `exx` or `root` in user lists
  - Prevents accidental lockout

### Future Considerations

- [ ] Extract oppy-specific modules to `modules/nixos/cslab-*` when Spirit migrates
- [ ] Evaluate if private user groups needed (currently imaging is primary)
- [ ] Consider dataset registry validation script integration

**Tracking**: Mark items complete by adding ‚úÖ and moving details to dated entry below.

## 2025-10-04 - CSLab Infrastructure Planning

**Goal**: Plan NixOS implementation of lab policies (user management, directory structure, monitoring)

**Analysis**:
- Reviewed existing Ansible implementation on Spirit (users.yml, directory structure, monitoring scripts)
- Discovered neusis already has user management via `lib/neusisOS.nix` and `users/cslab.nix`
- Decided on machine-specific implementation in `machines/oppy/` (extract to modules when Spirit migrates)

**Decision**: Create oppy-specific modules first, extract to shared modules only when proven on 2+ machines

**Next Steps**:
- Create `cslab-infrastructure.nix` - imaging group, /work/* directories
- Create `cslab-monitoring.nix` - systemd timers for quota checks
- Update `default.nix` to import these modules

**Status**: üîß Planning Complete

**Notes**: Following CLAUDE.md principle - "Let patterns emerge from real incidents before optimizing structure"

## 2025-10-04 - CSLab Infrastructure Implementation

**Goal**: Implement lab policies for directory structure, group membership, and monitoring

**Implementation**:

Created three files in `machines/oppy/`:

1. **`cslab-infrastructure.nix`**:
   - Creates `imaging` group (GID 1000) for all lab members
   - Adds `imaging` to extraGroups for all normal users (modifies users from neusisOS)
   - Creates `/work/{datasets,users,scratch,tools,users/_archive}` via systemd.tmpfiles (750 permissions, root:imaging)
   - Per-user directories via activation script: `/work/users/<user>` and `/work/scratch/<user>` (750, user:imaging)

2. **`cslab-monitoring.nix`**:
   - systemd timer: `cslab-check-quotas` (weekly, Monday 9 AM)
   - systemd service: Placeholder for quota monitoring (script path to be configured)
   - Log directory: `/var/log/lab-scripts/`
   - Future: scratch cleanup timer (commented out, ready when script exists)

3. **Updated `default.nix`**: Added imports for both cslab modules

**Testing**: ‚úÖ Deployed and verified on production Oppy

**Verification Results**:
```bash
# imaging group created with all 8 users
getent group imaging
# imaging:x:1000:amunoz,ank,jewald,jfredinh,ngogober,rshen,shsingh,spathak

# Users have imaging in their groups
id ank | grep imaging
# groups=...1000(imaging)

# /work/* structure exists (750 root:imaging)
ls -la /work/
# datasets, scratch, tools, users, users/_archive ‚úÖ

# Per-user directories exist (750 user:imaging)
ls -la /work/users/ank
# drwxr-x--- 2 ank imaging ‚úÖ

# systemd timer active
systemctl status cslab-check-quotas.timer
# Active: active (waiting), Next: Mon 09:03:59 EDT ‚úÖ
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Infrastructure deployed successfully

**Next Steps**:
1. ~~Configure monitoring script path~~ ‚úÖ Complete
2. ~~Add Slack webhook via agenix secret~~ ‚úÖ Complete
3. Implement scratch cleanup timer when script ready

## 2025-10-05 - Monitoring Script and Slack Integration

**Goal**: Wire up quota monitoring script with Slack notifications

**Implementation**:

1. **Copied check-quotas.nu** to `machines/oppy/scripts/check-quotas.nu`
2. **Updated cslab-monitoring.nix**:
   - Added `fd` to service PATH (required by script)
   - Updated script execution to use actual Nushell script
   - Added `SuccessExitStatus = [ 0 2 ]` (exit code 2 = user needs action, not failure)
3. **Slack integration via agenix**:
   - Added `oppy/slack_webhook.age` to `secrets/secrets.nix`
   - Created encrypted secret file with webhook URL
   - Declared secret in cslab-monitoring.nix (mode 400, root-only)
   - Export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL in service script from secret

**Testing**: ‚úÖ Deployed and verified on production Oppy

**Verification Results**:
```bash
sudo systemctl start cslab-check-quotas.service
# [INFO] Notified via Slack for user shsingh - 136.23GB used
# [INFO] Quota check complete: 10 users checked, 1 need action
# Service: Deactivated successfully ‚úÖ

# Check Slack channel - notification received ‚úÖ
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Full monitoring with Slack notifications operational

**Notes**:
- Script runs weekly Monday 9 AM via systemd timer
- Exit code 2 (user needs action) treated as success to avoid false failures
- Slack webhook stored securely via agenix (encrypted at rest)
- All 10 cslab users monitored automatically
- Found: shsingh over quota (136.23GB / 100GB soft limit)

**Notes**:
- Build succeeded on first try after fixing circular dependency (importing users/cslab.nix directly)
- Kept implementation machine-specific as planned - will extract to modules/ when Spirit proves it needs identical setup
- imaging group modifies users already created by neusisOS lib (clean separation of concerns)
- Monitoring service has placeholder script execution (needs script path configuration)
- All policies from imaging-server-maintenance now implemented in NixOS declaratively
