# Current 3-Drive Configuration for Oppy
# Adapted from disko-raidz2-future.nix to work with CURRENT hardware (3x Kioxia drives)
# Provides /work/ directory structure and snapshot policies WITHOUT redundancy
#
# BENEFITS NOW:
# - Get /work/ directory structure (datasets, users, scratch, tools)
# - Snapshot policies configured
# - Dataset organization matching lab policies
# - Practice with config before RAIDZ2 migration
#
# MIGRATION PATH (when 6 drives arrive):
# 1. Change mode = "" to mode = "raidz2"
# 2. Add 3 more kioxia drives (kioxia03, kioxia04, kioxia05)
# 3. Update serial numbers
# 4. Reinstall via nixos-anywhere
#
# WARNING: NO REDUNDANCY - stripe mode means any drive failure = total data loss
# This is the SAME risk as current zstore16, just with better organization
