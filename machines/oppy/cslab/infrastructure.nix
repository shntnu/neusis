# CSLab Infrastructure Configuration
#
# Implements cslab-specific policies for Oppy:
# - imaging group for all lab members
# - /work/* directory structure (datasets, users, scratch, tools)
# - Per-user directories with correct ownership and permissions
#
# References:
# - imaging-server-maintenance/policies/user-access.md
# - imaging-server-maintenance/policies/data-storage.md
#
# Note: This is oppy-specific. When Spirit migrates to NixOS, extract to
# modules/nixos/cslab-infrastructure.nix if identical setup needed.

        The following accounts must NEVER be managed by this configuration:
        - exx: Emergency admin account (prevents lockout)
        - root: System root account (security critical)

        Action required: Remove these accounts from users/cslab.nix immediately.
